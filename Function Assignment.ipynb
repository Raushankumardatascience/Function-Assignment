What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","**Function:**\n","- A function is a standalone block of code defined using the `def` keyword, designed to perform a specific task.\n","- It exists independently and is not tied to any object or class.\n","- Example:\n","  ```python\n","  def add(a, b):\n","      return a + b\n","  print(add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n","  ```\n","\n","**Method:**\n","- A method is a function that belongs to a class or object in Python.

Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","\n","**Generators**:\n","- Generators are a type of iterator that yield values one at a time, allowing memory-efficient processing of large or infinite sequences.\n","- They are defined using the `yield` keyword instead of `return`, pausing the function’s state between calls.\n","\n","**Defining Generators**:\n","1. **Generator Function** (using `def` and `yield`):\n","   ```python\n","   def my_generator():\n","       yield 1\n","       yield 2\n","       yield 3\n","   gen = my_generator()\n","   print(next(gen))  # Output: 1\n","   print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n","   ```\n","2. **Generator Expression** (similar to list comprehension but with parentheses):\n","   ```python\n","   gen = (x * 2 for x in range(3))\n","   print(next(gen))  # Output: 0\n","   print(next(gen))  # Output: 2\n","   ```\n","\n","**How They Work**:\n","- When called, a generator function returns a generator object without executing the function.\n","- Each `yield` pauses execution and returns a value; `next()` resumes from the last `yield`.\n","- When the generator is exhausted, it raises `StopIteration`.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","\n","1. **Memory Efficiency**:\n","   - Generators yield one value at a time, avoiding the need to store the entire sequence in memory.\n","   - Example: Generating a million numbers with a generator uses minimal memory compared to a list.\n","\n","2. **Lazy Evaluation**:\n","   - Values are computed only when requested, improving performance for large or infinite sequences.\n","   ```python\n","   def infinite_sequence():\n","       num = 0\n","       while True:\n","           yield num\n","           num += 1\n","   ```\n","\n","3. **Simplified Code**:\n","   - Generators handle iteration state automatically, reducing the need for manual iterator classes.\n","\n","4. **Pipeline Processing**:\n","   - Generators can be chained to process data in stages, improving readability and efficiency.\n","   ```python\n","   def square(nums):\n","       for num in nums:\n","           yield num * num\n","   gen = square([1, 2, 3])\n","   ```\n","\n","**Comparison**:\n","- Regular functions return all results at once (e.g., as a list), consuming more memory.\n","- Generators are ideal for streaming data, infinite sequences, or large datasets.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 8.

Each tuple consists of the order number and the product of the price per item and the quantity. The product should be increased by 10,- € if the value of the order is smaller than 100,00 €. Write a Python program using lambda and map.\n","\n","**Assumed Input Format**:\n","Since the sublist format wasn’t provided, I’ll assume it’s `[[order_number, book_title, quantity, price_per_item], ...]`. Example:\n","```python\n","orders = [\n","    [1, \"Book A\", 2, 30],  # Order 1: 2 * 30 = 60 < 100, so add 10\n","    [2, \"Book B\", 1, 120], # Order 2: 1 * 120 = 120 > 100, no addition\n","    [3, \"Book C\", 5, 15]   # Order 3: 5 * 15 = 75 < 100, so add 10\n","]\n","```\n","\n","**Explanation**:\n","- Use `map()` with a lambda function to process each sublist.\n","- For each sublist, compute `quantity * price_per_item`.\n","- If the product is less than 100, add 10.\n","- Return a tuple of `(order_number, adjusted_total)`.\n","\n","```python\n","def process_orders(orders):\n","    return list(map(lambda x: (x[0], x[2] * x[3] + (10 if x[2] * x[3] < 100 else 0)), orders))\n","```\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","orders = [\n","    [1, \"Book A\", 2, 30],\n","    [2, \"Book B\", 1, 120],\n","    [3, \"Book C\", 5, 15]\n","]\n","print(process_orders(orders))  # Output: [(1, 70.0), (2, 120.0), (3, 85.0)]\n","```\n","\n","**Breakdown**:\n","- Order 1: `2 * 30 = 60` (< 100, so `60 + 10 = 70`).\n","- Order 2: `1 * 120 = 120` (> 100, no addition).\n","- Order 3: `5 * 15 = 75` (< 100, so `75 + 10 = 85`).\n","\n","If the sublist format differs (e.g., different indices or structure), please provide the exact format, and I’ll update the solution.\n","\n","---\n","\n","This covers all 11 questions with complete code and explanations.
